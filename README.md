# Ideas1
This is where we are going to learn git and brainstorm the ideas we could do

to make a change to this file click the little draw sign at the top left of this window, 
put your ideas under your name

if you are done making a suggestion put a description, click "create a new branch" under the description, then "propose changes"

if at this point you see, "this branch has conflicts you must resolve", if it doesn't say that then skip to the last step
click "resolve conflicts"
everything in red is what conflicts,the top is your edit, the bottom is the mains edit, you will need to resolve the conflict yourself, and get rid of the "<<<<<fileName" and ">>>>>>main" at the top and bottom of the red area.
click "marked as resolved" and commit merge

click "create pull request", and if everything goes good, you can click the "merge pull request", and "and confirm merge"
